<!--Before Start, you should first know that every thing included in <!-- --> are comments. Comments are not displayed in the browser-->
<!--So most web apps work in a html-js-css system way. 
Html is the main file which usually have the main code. They usually contain the text and tells the broswer where are the other files. Usually there is only one html file in one page.(HTML is POWERFUL, so technically one html file can contain css and js content written in as a part of the file but that is uncommon and not a good code)
Js, or JavaScript is the file that contains the code, (if you see those html tags as codes, then its the logical codes.) They contain the code that will be executed during your gameplay.
Css, or Cascading Style Sheets are the files that contains the styles, like the color of the words or where is this bunch of content where is that bunch of content.
You might also see a lot of other files like png,jpg,(Which are The Pictures that will be included in the website),xml(A kind of file that is similar to html and sometimes work together with html),json(a kind of file that can contain all kind of information in a specific format).

So before start you also need a basic intro to html, js and css.

HTML (HyperText Markup Language):

What it is: The foundation of every website. It’s the language used to structure the content and meaning of a web page.
Purpose: Defines the elements that make up a webpage, like headings, paragraphs, images, links, forms, and more. Think of it as the skeleton or basic structure of a website.
How it works: Uses “tags” (like <p>, <h1>, <img>) to mark up elements on the page. These tags tell the browser how to display the content.
Example:
<h1>My Awesome Website</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
<img src="" alt="A cool image">

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):

What it is: A styling language used to control the visual presentation of HTML elements.
Purpose: Defines how HTML elements should look – things like colors, fonts, layout, spacing, and responsiveness. It separates the design from the content.
How it works: Uses rules that target specific HTML elements and apply styles to them. These rules can be written in separate CSS files or embedded directly in HTML.
Example:
h1 {
  color: blue;
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  text-align: center;
}
p {
  font-size: 16px;
  line-height: 1.5;
}

JavaScript (JS):

What it is: A programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites.
Purpose: Enables you to make webpages respond to user actions, update content without reloading the page, create animations, handle data, and much more.
How it works: JavaScript code is executed by the user’s web browser. It can manipulate the HTML structure and CSS styles of a page, as well as handle events (like button clicks).
Example:
function showAlert() {
  alert("Hello, world!");
}
And I highly recommend you to read all the passages in this tutorial(https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)from the start until paragraphs and div and iframe(this one is at very downwards.)

also html have a basic structure
<html>
	<head>
		Things that will not directly appear in the website, such as which file is to be included, or what should be the name of the tab page
	<\head>
	<body>
		Things that will directly appear in the website.
	<\body>
<\html>

and <div> is a special tag 
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>2048</title>
